HOW TO:
To execute type in the following comamnd:

python __init__.py assemblySource.txt 

############################


assemblySource.txt is where the assembly source code needs to be written

__init__.py initializes the hardware for the simulated computer

The number of registers and the size of the data and instruction memories can be edited here.

After __init__.py completes the initialiation process, it calls pipeline.py

Pipeline.py has some values initialized as well.  These are for storing values between 

pipeline stages.

Design Decisions

* Structural Hazards
Seperate memories for instructions and data.
This is a standard approach and prevents 
structural hazards.

* Data Hazards
When the decode function is called, it compares its source registers with the source
register of the write


*
Our pipeline has one main loop that it cycles through.  Each iteration of the loop represents
one clock cycle.
Each stage of the pipeline is called in this loop. The order they are executed in is:

1- Write Back
2- Memory
3- Execute
4- Instruction Decode
5- Instruction Fetch
